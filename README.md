# ESP32_bluetoothmedia
An esp32 used as a2dp sink attached to the bmw canbus for steering wheel controls

## Imported libs
* https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP
* [https://github.com/nhatuan84/esp32-can-protocol-demo](https://github.com/pierremolinaro/acan-esp32)

## Used parts
* ESP32: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/33004561102.html
* External DAC: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004491534008.html
* CAN transceiver: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005002844175352.html
* AUX pinout adapter (not really necessary, since the external DAC has output pins to attatch to): https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B009PH1IG4
* DC 8V-32V to DC 5V transformer: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09B818N5F
* Random USB-A to USB-C cable

## Wireing
* CAN 3.3V    -> ESP 3.3V
* CAN Ground  -> ESP Ground
* CAN RX      -> ESP pin D4 (GPIO 4)
* CAN TX      -> ESP pin D5 (GPIO 5)
* DAC 3.3V    -> ESP 3.3V
* DAC Ground  -> ESP Ground
* DAC FLT     -> ESP Ground
* DAC DMP     -> ESP Ground
* DAC SLC     -> ESP Ground
* DAC BCK     -> ESP pin D26 (GPIO 26)
* DAC DIN     -> ESP pin D22 (GPIO 22)
* DAC LCK     -> ESP pin D25 (GPIO 25)
* DAC FMT     -> ESP Ground
* DAC XMT     -> ESP 3.3V
* ESP USB-C   -> Transformer USB-A

**Remember to short the pins on the can transceiver, if you don't need the 120 Î© resistor as an endpoint.**

## Features
* Automatic reconnect to the last connected device is handled by the ESP32-A2DP-library

## Todos (maybe?)
* Set volume on bluetooth connect automatically to the maximum of the bluetooth device

## Ideas for your own implementation:
* a2dp can receive information about the song that is currently playing. You could attach a display to show the current artist and title.
